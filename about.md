I am a maths PhD student working with semigroups. I also have interests in category theory, topology, and combinatorics.

This website is where I will shamelessly presume to know enough to write about mathematics.

With that in mind you are free to treat what you read here as an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein%27s_ladder">Wittgenstein's ladder</a>.
